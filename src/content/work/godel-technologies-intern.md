During an internship, I had to absorb loads of information and learn new skills really fast. I observed how development teams work, was exposed to almost every part of SDLC, experienced Agile methodologies for the first time, and (worth mentioning) achieved the highest code contribution among three interns.

- Helped a team to develop a full-stack application using TypeScript, React, and Express.
- Designed and implemented reusable and responsive UI components.
- Fixed bugs, wrote unit, integration, and E2E tests using Jest, RTL and Playwright libraries.
- Worked in a Scrum environment, contributed to sprint planning, and participated in daily stand-ups.
