This has been the most impactful phase of my career so far. I had managers who trusted me with full project ownership, allowing me to build tools independently or lead developmentâ€”despite being a junior engineer.

- Built an enterprise-grade GitLab/Jira-integrated deployment tracker and release scheduler, now adopted company-wide by 100+ engineers. This service introduced new comfortable workflow for scheduling releases, replacing the old manual way.
- Developed a tool to automate test case generation for JsonLogic-powered tests that was previously done in a painfully manual way, saving tons of not only my time, but my whole team's engineers' time as well.
- Helped to migrate several services from a React-REST-API architecture to an MVC architecture using Node.js and Nunjucks, improving data integrity and overall user experience.
