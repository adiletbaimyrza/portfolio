**clines** is a simple CLI tool that counts the number of LOC in your project and updates your `README.md` with the results. It also categorizes your project based on its size.

### Example Output in `README.md`

After running `clines`, your `README.md` might look like this:

> Lines of Code: **6999**  
> Project Size: **<span style="color: magenta;">Well-structured project ‚öôÔ∏è</span>**
>
> | Extension | Files | Effective LOC |
> | --------- | ----- | ------------: |
> | `.ts`     | 62    |          3210 |
> | `.tsx`    | 41    |          2212 |
> | `.js`     | 18    |           935 |
> | `.css`    | 6     |           542 |

## Installation

Install locally as a development dependency:

```sh
npm install --save-dev clines
```

## Usage

Run the command in your project's root directory:

```sh
npx clines
```

You can also specify a directory:

```sh
npx clines path/to/directory
```

## Configuration

To customize which files and directories should be excluded from the line count, create a `clines.json` file in the root of your project. If this file does not exist, `clines` will generate one with the following default settings:

```json
{
  "ignoreFiles": [
    ".log",
    ".gitignore",
    ".csv",
    ".ini",
    ".env",
    ".LICENSE",
    ".gitmodules"
  ],
  "ignoreDirs": [
    "node_modules",
    "dist",
    "build",
    "coverage",
    "logs",
    ".git",
    ".idea",
    ".vscode",
    "tmp",
    "out",
    "public",
    "static"
  ]
}
```

- `ignoreFiles`: Specifies file extensions that should be ignored.
- `ignoreDirs`: Defines directories that should be excluded from the count.

## How It Works

- Recursively counts lines of code in the specified directory.
- Ignores files and directories based on `clines.json` settings.
- Updates `README.md` with the total line count inside the placeholders:

```md
<!-- LINE_COUNT_PLACEHOLDER_1 -->

**Total Files:** `147`  
**Lines of Code:** `6999`  
**Project Size:** Well-structured project ‚öôÔ∏è

| Extension | Files | Effective LOC |
| --------- | ----- | ------------: |
| `.ts`     | 62    |          3210 |
| `.tsx`    | 41    |          2212 |
| `.js`     | 18    |           935 |
| `.css`    | 6     |           542 |

<!-- LINE_COUNT_PLACEHOLDER_2 -->
```

- You can place `<!-- LINE_COUNT_PLACEHOLDER_1 -->` and `<!-- LINE_COUNT_PLACEHOLDER_2 -->` anywhere in your `README.md`, and `clines` will update the content inside them.
- If no placeholders are provided, `clines` will append the line count information at the end of `README.md`.

## Project Size Labels

| Lines of Code | Project Size Label         |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| < 500         | Tiny scriptlet üí°          |
| < 2000        | Compact utility üõ†Ô∏è         |
| < 5000        | Growing codebase üèóÔ∏è        |
| < 10000       | Well-structured project ‚öôÔ∏è |
| < 20000       | Robust system üî¨           |
| < 50000       | Complex software üè¢        |
