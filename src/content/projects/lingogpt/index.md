LingoGPT is an AI-powered translating tool designed specifically for multilinguals such as myself. It provides features like translations and definitions in multiple languages, IPA transcription, synonyms, usage examples, flashcards, and activity tracking, all powered by Meta's Llama model.

The reason behind creating this applicaiton is that I've always been frustrated with the way how current translating tools work. I've been learning languages my whole life, and I've developed a certain approach to how I learn new words, which current services just don't support.

For example, when studying Polish, I want a definition in Polish, but translations in Russian and English. I also need the synonyms, and usage examples. The ChatGPT can do all that, but the problem is it’s not designed to be an effective language-learning tool, and such a tool, at the very least, should track translated words, which is crucial for later revision.

So, I built my own translation tool. It is customizable, with word tracking, stats, and auto-generated flashcards. Now, what once took me multiple steps happens in one click, which is awesome. I designed it to be flexible for anyone. It supports 40 languages. There is no authentication - everything is stored locally for now. Soon, I’ll add cloud sync so it's going to be possible to pick up where I left off on any device.
