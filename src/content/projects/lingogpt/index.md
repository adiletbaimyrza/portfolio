LingoGPT is an AI-powered translating tool designed for multilinguals such as myself. It provides features like translations, IPA transcription, synonyms, usage examples, flashcards, and activity tracking, all powered by Meta's Llama model.

I've always been frustrated with the way how current translating tools work - especially as a multilingual person. I've been learning languages my whole life, and I've developed a certain approach to how I learn new words, which current services just don't support.

For example, when studying Polish, I want a definition in Polish, but translations in Russian and English. I also need the synonyms, and usage examples. The ChatGPT can do all that, but the problem is it’s not designed to be an effective language-learning tool, and such a tool, at the very least, should track translated words, which is crucial for later revision.

My old workflow was painfully manual. First, I’d promptfigure ChatGPT to get translations, definitions, and synonyms in my chosen languages, then jot each word into a notebook before finally creating Anki flashcards. It had become such drudgery that the process alone was stealing the joy of learning a new language from me. So I built my own translation tool. It is customizable, with word tracking, stats, and auto-generated flashcards. Now, what once took me multiple steps happens in one click, which is awesome.

I am not sure how many people out there share my approach to learning vocabulary, but I designed it to be flexible for anyone. It supports 40 languages. There is no authentication - everything is stored locally for now. Soon, I’ll add cloud sync so you can pick up where you left off on any device.
